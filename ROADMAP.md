# 86'd Roadmap

> A living roadmap for prioritizing the next product and gameplay improvements.

## Guiding Principles
- **Teach real restaurant lessons.** Each feature should reinforce a practical industry insight.
- **Reduce decision fatigue.** Make the next best action obvious, especially for new players.
- **Reward mastery.** Add depth for returning players without overwhelming new ones.
- **Maintain cross-platform parity.** Features should work on iOS, Android, and Web.

## Phased Delivery
See `docs/roadmap/README.md` for detailed phase breakdowns, checklists, and metrics.

## Now (0-4 weeks)
- Interactive first-3-weeks tutorial with guided actions.
- Weekly recap panel explaining profit/loss drivers.
- Actionable insights panel with top 2-3 recommended actions.
- Save slot naming + last played metadata.

## Next (1-3 months)
- Scenario timeline with cause/effect tagging.
- Milestone goals layered on top of win conditions.
- Equipment lifecycle (maintenance, depreciation, upgrades).
- Difficulty presets (casual, standard, hardcore).
- Expanded staff dynamics and LTO menu experimentation.

## Later (3-6 months)
- Challenge mode with seeded runs and leaderboard metrics.
- Shareable year-end recap.
- Cloud sync (opt-in).
- Multi-location management view with alerts.
- Regional expansion with supply chain/saturation.
- Franchise system depth (standards, audits).

## Metrics to Track
- Day 1 / Day 7 retention
- Tutorial completion rate
- First win condition completion rate
- Run abandonment points (week number)
- Mentor engagement rate
- Scenario-trigger frequency vs. player churn

## Open Questions
- Should the AI mentor be optional by default or opt-out?
- What are the minimum “core loops” that must remain fast on mobile?
- How much realism should we trade for accessibility on casual difficulty?
