## Functional Requirements
### Challenge Mode

- End-of-run metrics for leaderboards.

### Year-End Recap

### Multi-Location Management
- KPI rollups and automated alerts (cash runway, morale dips).

### Regional Expansion

### Franchise Depth
- Brand standards enforcement, compliance audits, royalty negotiation.
